# Chapter: Chhattisgarh

## 1. Introduction

Chhattisgarh, located in central India, is a state known for its rich natural resources, diverse tribal culture, and significant contribution to India's mineral wealth. Formed on November 1, 2000, by carving out 16 districts from the state of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh is one of the youngest states in India. Bordered by Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra to the west, Uttar Pradesh to the north, Jharkhand to the northeast, Odisha to the east, and Telangana and Andhra Pradesh to the south, Chhattisgarh plays a vital role in India's economic and cultural landscape. The state is renowned for its mineral reserves, dense forests, waterfalls, and the unique traditions of its tribal communities.

## 2. Historical Background

The history of Chhattisgarh is marked by the presence of ancient kingdoms, tribal dynasties, and significant socio-cultural movements. The region has been mentioned in ancient texts and epics like the Mahabharata, and it has a long history of human settlement. The region was once part of the ancient Dandakaranya, a vast forest area mentioned in the Ramayana, and has seen the rise and fall of several empires and dynasties over the centuries.

During medieval times, Chhattisgarh was ruled by various Rajput and Gond dynasties. The Kalachuri dynasty of Ratanpur was a significant power in the region during the 10th to 18th centuries. The Marathas gained control of the area in the 18th century, followed by British colonial rule in the 19th century. Under British rule, Chhattisgarh was part of the Central Provinces and Berar.

Post-independence, Chhattisgarh remained part of Madhya Pradesh until 2000 when it was granted statehood to address regional disparities and promote more focused governance and development. The creation of the new state was aimed at addressing the unique challenges faced by the region, particularly those related to its tribal population and economic development.

## 3. Geography and Climate

Chhattisgarh is characterized by its diverse geography, which includes dense forests, rolling hills, plateaus, and fertile plains. The state is part of the Deccan Plateau and is surrounded by the Satpura Range to the north and the Eastern Ghats to the south. The Mahanadi River, one of India's major rivers, flows through the state, along with its tributaries, providing essential water resources for agriculture and hydroelectric power.

The climate of Chhattisgarh varies from tropical to sub-tropical, with hot summers, a monsoon season, and mild winters. Summers (March to June) can be quite hot, with temperatures often rising above 40°C (104°F). The monsoon season (July to September) brings substantial rainfall, which is crucial for agriculture but can also lead to flooding in some regions. Winters (November to February) are relatively mild, with temperatures ranging from 10°C to 25°C (50°F to 77°F).

## 4. Economy

The economy of Chhattisgarh is diverse, with significant contributions from agriculture, industry, and mining. The state is often referred to as the "rice bowl of India" due to its extensive rice production. Agriculture remains the primary occupation for a majority of the population, with rice, maize, pulses, oilseeds, and various fruits and vegetables being the major crops. The fertile plains of the Mahanadi River and the extensive use of irrigation contribute to agricultural productivity.

Chhattisgarh is one of India's most mineral-rich states, with vast reserves of coal, iron ore, limestone, bauxite, and dolomite. The state's mining sector plays a crucial role in its economy, contributing significantly to its Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP). Major mining operations include coal mining, iron ore extraction, and limestone quarrying. The state is also a major producer of steel and is home to several large steel plants, including those in Bhilai, which is one of India's largest steel manufacturing centers.

The industrial sector in Chhattisgarh has been growing steadily, with a focus on steel, power, cement, and aluminum production. The state has attracted significant investments in these sectors due to its rich natural resources and favorable industrial policies. The government has also been promoting small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to boost local economic development and employment.

Tourism is an emerging sector in Chhattisgarh, with its natural beauty, wildlife, and unique tribal culture attracting visitors from across India and abroad. The state's government has been promoting eco-tourism, cultural tourism, and adventure tourism to capitalize on its natural and cultural assets.

## 5. Culture and Heritage

Chhattisgarh is known for its rich cultural heritage, particularly its tribal culture and traditions. The state is home to a significant tribal population, including major tribes like the Gond, Baiga, Halba, Bhatra, and Oraon, each with its unique customs, languages, and traditions. These tribes have preserved their ancient customs, practices, and art forms, contributing to the state's cultural diversity.

Traditional music and dance play a vital role in the cultural life of Chhattisgarh. Folk dances such as Panthi, Raut Nacha, and Suwa are performed during festivals and celebrations, often accompanied by traditional instruments like the mandar and dholak. These dances are not just forms of entertainment but are deeply intertwined with the religious and social life of the tribal communities.

Chhattisgarh is also known for its traditional crafts, including bell metal craft, wood carving, bamboo work, and weaving. The state is particularly famous for its Dokra art, a type of metal casting that uses the lost-wax technique, and Bastar art, which includes intricate carvings and sculptures made from wood and other materials.

Festivals are an integral part of life in Chhattisgarh, reflecting its cultural diversity and religious traditions. Some of the major festivals celebrated in the state include Dussehra, Diwali, Holi, and Makar Sankranti, along with tribal festivals such as Bhagoriya, Madai, and Goncha, which are celebrated with great enthusiasm and community participation.

## 6. Governance and Administration

Chhattisgarh is governed by a democratically elected government with a unicameral legislative assembly. The state is divided into 33 districts, each administered by a District Collector. Raipur, the state capital, serves as the administrative, political, and economic hub of Chhattisgarh.

The state government has focused on various development initiatives to improve infrastructure, education, healthcare, and social welfare. Chhattisgarh has implemented several reforms to enhance governance, promote transparency, and improve service delivery. The government has also prioritized rural development, tribal welfare, and poverty alleviation through various schemes and programs.

## 7. Education and Healthcare

Notable institutions in Chhattisgarh include the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bhilai, National Institute of Technology (NIT) Raipur, and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Raipur.

The government has implemented various programs to promote education, particularly for marginalized communities, through initiatives such as the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, Mid-Day Meal Scheme, and scholarship programs for students from economically weaker sections.

Healthcare in Chhattisgarh faces challenges due to its large rural and tribal population and limited healthcare infrastructure. However, the government has been working to improve healthcare facilities and services. Efforts include the establishment of primary health centers, community health centers, and district hospitals. The state is also focusing on maternal and child health, disease prevention, and health education through various public health programs.

## 8. Challenges and Future Prospects

Chhattisgarh faces several challenges, including poverty, unemployment, infrastructure development, and Naxalism (left-wing extremism). The state is also grappling with issues related to environmental sustainability, such as deforestation and mining-related impacts on ecosystems and communities.

However, Chhattisgarh has significant potential for growth and development. With its rich natural resources, strategic location, and cultural diversity, the state has the resources to transform its economy and improve the quality of life for its people. Key areas of focus for Chhattisgarh's future development include improving infrastructure, enhancing agricultural productivity, promoting industrialization, and investing in human capital through education and healthcare.

The state government, along with the central government, has been working on various initiatives to address these challenges and promote sustainable development. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its challenges, Chhattisgarh can build a prosperous and inclusive future for its people.
