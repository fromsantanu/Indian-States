# Chapter: Haryana

## 1. Introduction

Haryana, located in northern India, is a state known for its robust agricultural sector, rapid industrial growth, and rich cultural heritage. Formed on November 1, 1966, when it was carved out of Punjab on linguistic grounds, Haryana has played a significant role in India's socio-economic development. Bordered by Punjab to the north, Himachal Pradesh to the northeast, Uttarakhand to the east, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi to the south-east, and Rajasthan to the south and southwest, Haryana surrounds the national capital, Delhi, on three sides, making it a crucial part of the National Capital Region (NCR).

## 2. Historical Background

Haryana has a rich and diverse history that dates back to ancient times. The region is considered one of the oldest cradles of Indian civilization, with its roots in the Vedic period. It is believed that the epic battles of the Mahabharata were fought on the plains of Kurukshetra, a significant cultural and historical site in Haryana. The area was known as Brahmavarta, the cradle of Indian civilization, during the Vedic period, reflecting its spiritual and historical significance.

Throughout its history, Haryana has been influenced by various dynasties and empires, including the Mauryas, Guptas, and Kushans. The region witnessed significant developments during the medieval period, especially under the rule of the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire. Several battles that shaped India's history, such as the Battles of Panipat, were fought in Haryana.

During the British colonial period, Haryana was part of the Punjab Province. The state played a vital role in India's struggle for independence, with many of its people participating in the freedom movement. After India gained independence in 1947, Haryana continued to be part of Punjab until 1966, when it was reorganized as a separate state based on linguistic lines to provide better administrative governance and cater to the specific needs of its predominantly Hindi-speaking population.

## 3. Geography and Climate

Haryana is characterized by its diverse geography, which includes flat plains, rolling hills, and arid regions. The state is predominantly an alluvial plain, drained by the Yamuna River along its eastern boundary. Haryana's geography can be divided into four main regions: the Shivalik Hills in the northeast, the Yamuna-Ghaggar Plain, the Aravalli Range in the south, and the semi-arid sandy plains in the southwest.

The climate of Haryana varies from hot and arid to humid and subtropical. The state experiences three main seasons: summer (March to June), monsoon (July to September), and winter (October to February). Summers are typically hot, with temperatures often exceeding 40°C (104°F), particularly in the southern and western regions. The monsoon season brings moderate to heavy rainfall, which is crucial for agriculture but can sometimes cause localized flooding. Winters are cool and pleasant, with temperatures ranging from 5°C to 20°C (41°F to 68°F).
