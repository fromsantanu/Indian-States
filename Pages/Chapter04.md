# Chapter: Bihar

## 1. Introduction

Bihar, located in the eastern part of India, is a state known for its ancient history, rich cultural heritage, and dynamic socio-political landscape. The state is bordered by Nepal to the north, West Bengal to the east, Jharkhand to the south, and Uttar Pradesh to the west. Bihar is traversed by the Ganges River, which flows from west to east, nourishing its fertile plains. With a diverse population and a blend of ancient traditions and modern aspirations, Bihar is a state of contrasts and opportunities.

## 2. Historical Background

Bihar has a remarkable history that dates back to ancient times, playing a crucial role in the development of Indian civilization. The state was the center of powerful empires and significant religious movements. The ancient kingdom of Magadha, with its capital at Pataliputra (modern-day Patna), was a dominant political and cultural force in India. It gave rise to several major empires, including the Maurya and Gupta Empires, which are known for their contributions to art, science, and administration.

Bihar is also a significant center for Buddhism and Jainism. It was in Bodh Gaya that Siddhartha Gautama attained enlightenment and became the Buddha, making it one of the most important pilgrimage sites for Buddhists worldwide. Similarly, Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara of Jainism, was born in Bihar, making it a crucial region for the Jain community.

During the medieval period, Bihar was part of the Mughal Empire and later became a battleground during the British colonial period. The state played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence, with leaders like Mahatma Gandhi launching significant movements, such as the Champaran Satyagraha, from its soil.

After independence in 1947, Bihar continued to play a significant role in India's socio-political landscape. The state was bifurcated in 2000 to create the new state of Jharkhand, resulting in a significant reorganization of resources and governance.

## 3. Geography and Climate

Bihar is characterized by its flat topography and fertile plains, which are largely shaped by the Ganges River and its tributaries, such as the Gandak, Kosi, and Son rivers. The state's geography can be divided into two regions: the North Bihar Plains and the South Bihar Plains, separated by the Ganges River. The fertile alluvial soil of the plains makes Bihar one of the most agriculturally productive regions in India.

The climate of Bihar is typically subtropical, with hot summers, a monsoon season, and mild winters. The summer months (April to June) can be quite hot, with temperatures often exceeding 40°C (104°F). The monsoon season (July to September) brings heavy rainfall, which is crucial for agriculture but can also lead to flooding, particularly in the northern regions. Winters (November to February) are mild and pleasant, with temperatures ranging from 5°C to 15°C (41°F to 59°F).

## 4. Economy

The economy of Bihar is predominantly agrarian, with agriculture and allied activities being the backbone of the state's economy. Major crops grown in Bihar include rice, wheat, maize, pulses, and sugarcane. The state's fertile plains and abundant water resources make it well-suited for agricultural production. In recent years, Bihar has also seen growth in horticulture, with increased production of fruits such as mangoes, litchis, and bananas.

Despite its agricultural strength, Bihar has been traditionally considered one of the less developed states in India in terms of industrialization and infrastructure. However, the state has made significant strides in recent years to improve its economic landscape. The government has focused on developing infrastructure, attracting investments, and promoting small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

The service sector, particularly in education and healthcare, has also been growing in Bihar. The state has several educational institutions, including prestigious universities and medical colleges, contributing to its economy and human capital development. Additionally, the government has implemented various welfare schemes and development programs aimed at improving the socio-economic conditions of its population.

Tourism is another sector with significant potential in Bihar, given its rich cultural heritage and historical significance. The state is home to several important religious and historical sites, including Bodh Gaya, Nalanda, Vaishali, Rajgir, and Patna. These sites attract tourists, pilgrims, and researchers from around the world, contributing to the local economy.

## 5. Culture and Heritage

These songs often accompany various life events, festivals, and rituals, adding color and vibrancy to social gatherings.

Dance forms like Jat-Jatin, Bidesia, and Jhijhiya are popular in rural areas and are performed during festivals and celebrations. These dances often depict stories of love, nature, and social issues, reflecting the daily lives and emotions of the people.

Bihar is also known for its traditional crafts, including Madhubani painting, a unique art form that originated in the Mithila region. Madhubani paintings are characterized by intricate patterns and vibrant colors, often depicting mythological themes and nature. Other crafts include Sujni embroidery, Sikki grass weaving, and terracotta pottery, showcasing the state's rich artistic traditions.

Festivals play a significant role in the cultural life of Bihar. Chhath Puja is one of the most important festivals in the state, dedicated to the Sun God and celebrated with great devotion and enthusiasm. Other major festivals include Holi, Diwali, Eid, Durga Puja, and Saraswati Puja, reflecting the religious diversity and communal harmony of the state.

## 6. Governance and Administration

Bihar is governed by a democratically elected government with a bicameral legislature, comprising the Bihar Legislative Assembly and the Bihar Legislative Council. The state is divided into 38 districts, each administered by a District Magistrate or Deputy Commissioner. Patna, the state capital, serves as the administrative, political, and economic hub of Bihar.

The state government has been focusing on various development initiatives to improve infrastructure, education, healthcare, and social welfare.

The government has implemented various programs to promote education, particularly for marginalized communities, through initiatives such as the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, Mid-Day Meal Scheme, and scholarship programs for students from economically weaker sections.
