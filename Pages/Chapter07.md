Gujarat, located on the western coast of India, is a state renowned for its rich cultural heritage, entrepreneurial spirit, and significant economic contributions. Bordered by Rajasthan to the northeast, Madhya Pradesh to the east, Maharashtra to the southeast, the Arabian Sea to the west and southwest, and Pakistan to the northwest, Gujarat is strategically positioned as a gateway to both inland India and international waters. Known for its historical landmarks, vibrant traditions, and as the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, Gujarat is a unique blend of ancient and modern, traditional and progressive.

## 2. Historical Background

Gujarat has a long and illustrious history that dates back to ancient times. The region was home to one of the world’s oldest civilizations, the Indus Valley Civilization, with sites like Lothal and Dholavira showcasing its early urban planning, trade, and craftsmanship. Over the centuries, Gujarat has been influenced by various dynasties and empires, including the Mauryas, Guptas, and the Solankis.

The region became a significant trade center during the medieval period due to its strategic coastal location and was part of the Silk Road. Gujarat's ports facilitated trade with Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia, bringing in wealth and cultural exchange. The state also witnessed the rise of several powerful sultanates and kingdoms, such as the Gujarat Sultanate, which contributed to the region’s cultural and architectural heritage.

During the Mughal era, Gujarat was an important province, known for its commercial prosperity and strategic ports. It became a part of the Maratha Empire in the 18th century before falling under British control in the early 19th century. Gujarat played a crucial role in India’s struggle for independence, being the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, who led several key movements against British colonial rule.

After India gained independence in 1947, Gujarat was part of the Bombay State until 1960, when it was reorganized on a linguistic basis to form the separate state of Gujarat.
